## Project: design and implement classes for a car rental.

1. Projects must be made individually.
2. In the project it is necessary to create at least one class with a constructor and appropriate methods. It is also necessary to use at least one of the STL containers e.g. vector, map or other.
3. If it makes any sense for the particular project, the program should also make use of class inheritance, interfaces, exception handling, virtual functions and recurrence.
4. There should be at least minimal input values validation. For instance, when the program expects that a user enters a digit, the program should check if the provided string is actually a digit or not and let the user know when the wrong input was provided. It is unacceptable that the project terminates or falls into an infinite loop when the wrong input is provided.
5. There is no need to create the graphical user interface. It is enough that the project runs in the terminal and text mode.
6. In the main menu, there should be an option that terminates the program. It should also be possible to return to the main menu from any submenu.
7. The project can use external open source libraries, like for instance database server sqlite etc.
8. All changes made during the program execution should be saved (e.g. in files) and restored upon the program startup.
9. The project should be compiled with warnings set to level three. The source code should be written in such a way that there should be no warnings during the compilation. Only a few warnings are acceptable provided that they are difficult to remove.
10. Do not use new and delete operators for dynamic memory allocation. Instead, if you need a pointer, use smart pointers.
11. The source code should be well formatted and cleaned of all unused code. There should be comments in the source code explaining the usage of all functions and classes. Most variables (except for loop indexes) should have the names that are meaningful.
